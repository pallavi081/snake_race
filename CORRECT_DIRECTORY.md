The `npm install` command is failing because it is being run in the wrong directory.

The correct directory is: `c:\Users\rajpr\Downloads\snake_race-main\snake_race-main`

You are currently in: `C:\Users\rajpr\Downloads\snake_race-main`

You need to change directory into the `snake_race-main` folder first.

Run this command:
`cd snake_race-main`

Then run:
`npm install`
`npm run dev`
